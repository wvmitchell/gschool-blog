Well, week 2 is in the books, and with it the first major project of gSchool. The focus of the work this week was to take data from a CSV file and parse it into our own defined objects. I got to work with fellow gSchooler and all around rockstar Tyler Long on this project, which was absolutely fantastic. If you're interested at all in checking out my codebase for the project you can find it <a href="http://www.github.com/wvmitchell/event_reporter" target='blank'>here.</a>

So how's it going outside of the code? I'd say fantastic. It's funny really, when you really enjoy the work you're doing, it doesn't feel so much like work, and the long hours are much more tolerable. A real highlight for me through the first two weeks has been being able to help some of my fellow students with the concepts we're covering. Not only do I get a great deal of satisfaction out of helping someone to understand complex, but I'm finding that my own understand of the topics we're covering has improved greatly.

I should say though, as much as I'm enjoying the program, at this very moment, I'm totally exhausted. 65 hours of coding in one week is no joke, and I need a good night's sleep. So that's what I'm going to go do. Thanks for reading!
