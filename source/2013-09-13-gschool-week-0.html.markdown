Week one is finished, and what a whirlwind it has been! I've spent roughly 60 hours over the last week coding, learning, helping my classmates, and making some great new friends. Honestly it's been a fast week, and it's hard to believe just how much information we've covered in such a short time. I'm having a great time, altough it would be incorrect to say I don't have any worries about the coming months.

As I see it, I can't really afford to get sick. No flu, no thank you. Losing a week here would be like not doing any learning on my own for two months. 

Getting up early to go code has been a change, but a welcome one. I've enjoyed the work so much in fact that I actually find myself looking forward to the impending workload at 6:30 in the morning. I can't say that's something I ever experienced during my undergraduate degree at CU.

So what exactly have we covered? Here's a few highlights:

Ruby in 100 minutes - The fastest crash course I've ever seen to a new programming language.

Event Manager - Our first project, the result of a self guided tutorial.
