Week one is finished, and what a whirlwind it has been! I've spent roughly 60 hours over the last week coding, learning, helping my classmates, and making some great new friends. Honestly it's been a fast week, and it's hard to believe just how much information we've covered in such a short time. I'm having a great time, altough it would be incorrect to say I don't have any worries about the coming months.

As I see it, I can't really afford to get sick. No flu, no thank you. Losing a week here would be like not doing any learning on my own for two months. 

Getting up early to go code has been a change, but a welcome one. I've enjoyed the work so much in fact that I actually find myself looking forward to the impending workload at 6:30 in the morning. I can't say that's something I ever experienced during my undergraduate degree at CU.

So what exactly have we covered? Here's a few highlights:

Ruby in 100 minutes - The fastest crash course I've ever seen to a new programming language.

Event Manager - Our first project, the result of a self guided tutorial.

Encryptor - Day two's assigned work, I've spent some extra time with this one to try and slim down my code.

Microblogger - Day three, spent building this application which interacts with Twitter, making tweets and sending direct messages

We've also spent a good amount of time discussing the culture of the software engineering world, and what all we can expect to get out of the program. So far, I've been blown away by the quality of my peers in the class. I've never been a part of such a smart, motivated, group of people. Moving forward, I'm excited to see what we're able to accomplish together.
