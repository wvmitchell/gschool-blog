Week one is finished, and what a whirlwind it has been! I've spent roughly 60 hours over the last week coding, learning, helping my classmates, and making some great new friends. Honestly it's been a fast week, and it's hard to believe just how much information we've covered in such a short time. I'm having a great time, altough it would be incorrect to say I don't have any worries about the coming months.

As I see it, I can't really afford to get sick. No flu, no thank you. Losing a week here would be like not doing any learning on my own for two months.
