##Stumbling across the finish line

Last week we finished our ideabox, and while I both finished the base project,
and managed to complete some extensions, I was far from pleased with my final
result. As I see it, the reason for this is twofold. The first week of our
project was also my first lightning talk, and working on that took up a much
larger amount of time than I had anticipated. Additionally, I opted to try
building my own user class, for the purposes of user authentication. While this
was a good learning experience, I encountered many obstacles, and ultimately had
to scrap my best laid plans in favor of a different type of authentication.

If I were to go back and do the project again, I think I would have started with
an easier extension, which might have allowed me to gain some momentum. Starting
with the user authentication piece was a lot to handle all at once, and became
somewhat disheartening.

The project was not without a fair number of positives however. I am quickly
feeling better about my ability to test my applications, both from a unit
perspective, and an end-to-end feature perspective. While I've noticed an
additional up front time commitment when testing, I can clearly see how this
strategy will cause my work to be easier to change in the future.

I'm also feeling much more comfortable with the process of building web
applications, their organization, and how I should go about building out certain
features. That being said, I'm looking forward to getting more practice with all
of the web application pieces, particularly databases. While the fog is
clearing, it's still far from a sunny day.

This post wouldn't be complete without some account of our recent code retreat.
This was a new experience on several fronts for all of us, and I enjoyed it
a great deal. For my readers who aren't in the class, few though you might be,
a brief synopsis:

Our entire group went of campus last friday to a converted wearhouse indoor
market, and spent the day coding in pairs. In the morning we worked on a problem
recreating the 99 bottles of beer song, and in the afternoon we created
a representation of a robot. Where it got interesting was the restrictions which
were gradually placed on us while we were working. My favorite session was a 40
min stretch solving the robot problem, all without being able to talk, or write
more than one line of code at a time.

So, 7+ weeks in, things are going very well. I'm happy with my progress, as well
as my prospects for the rest of the class and beyond. The end of this week will
mark the 1/3 point of the course. It's a little difficult for me to account for
where the time has gone, but I guess that's how it goes when you're having fun.
