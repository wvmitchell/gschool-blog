Alright, perhaps that's being a bit dramatic, but either way, one of my fears
about this program was realized this week. Given how busy we are, and how much
material there is to cover, I can hardly afford to get sick. Wouldn't you know
it, Friday afternoon of last week, the scratchy throat stikes, and fever sets
in. Thus, suffice to say, the last week has been a bit of an extra challenge.
One of the realities about knowledge driven work is that you need to have
a clear head to make any reasonable headway.

Fortunately, this nasty cold occured during one of our focus weeks (no project
in the works), so I was able to get by on 70% capacity. To that end, I got to
work on a version of Tic-Tac-Toe with Simon (@SimonTaranto) and Meeka
(@CCandUC). Don't laugh, it's harder than it sounds! The one of the big
challenges for us was taking some code which I'd written at home while sick,
and combining it with code that Simon and Meeka had written. This was my first
exposure to coding with more than two people, and seeing how we incorporated
each others skill sets was intriguing to me.

Additionally, I've switched to a different code editor, VIM. VIM is built on the
premise that if you don't have to move your hands, you'll be able to work much
faster. Thus, no mouse, no arrow keys. Eventually no backspace key even. All of
the work is done with key commands, and your fingers rarely leave 'home row'.
I can see, even after a week, how I will eventually be much faster. However,
it's going to take some time to be sure. I figure though, what else am I here
for, if not to learn new things?

Looking ahead, we are finally turning to web work next week, taking our much
improved programming skills to the world of web applications. I'm both excited
about the shift in focus, as well as working on projects which I'll be able to
more easily share with friends and family.

Until we meet again,
