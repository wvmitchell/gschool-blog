It's hard to believe, but 8 of the 24 weeks I'll be spending here are gSchool
are now gone. The pace of the class, as expected, is pretty daunting. I'm
currently reading 5 different books related to the material we're covering in
class, in addition to all of the programming work we have to do. Next week,
we're finally getting into ruby on rails. Althoug this will not be my first
exposure to RoR, I'm excited to take what I've learned over the last two months,
and apply it.

This week we worked on a project called clone wars, the basic premise of which
was to take the information from a local website, an recreate it using what'd
we'd already learned. I used this project as an opprotunity to gain a better
understanding of SQL databases, how and when they should be used, and how one
actually goes about setting up a test database.

This project also gave us more practice writing unit, acceptance, and feature
tests. While I still feel that my ability to test my software is somewhat raw,
I absolutely feel that I'm improving. Considering that when I first came to this
program, I'd never written a test before, and was unclear on why or how one
would even do this, I'd say I've made good progress to this point.

If our team had another week to focus on the clone wars project, I think we'd
have to turn our attention towards improving the code in our views. Most of the
views are full static html pages, with very little erb templating taking place.
As such, changes to the views are a major pain, and an overhaul would do much to
improve the quality of the project. That being said, the end result of the
project looks pretty good, and I'm happy with the progress we made over the
three days we worked on it.

Working in a three person group, all on one codebase, was a challenging and fun
experience for me. Regardless of our various levels of skill coding, it became
clear quickly that we would all need to focus on using Git correctly, in order
tie our work together in an orderly manner. I think realizing this early helped
our group in a big way by speeding up our overall workflow, and keeping us on
pace to reach our stated goals.

This weekend we dip our toes into the Rails world, and next week we dive in
headfirst. I can't wait.
