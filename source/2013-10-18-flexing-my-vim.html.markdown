After talking to a developer that works here at Galvanize, I decided to take all
this learning I'm doing one step further, and try to begin using a new text
editor, VIM. VIM is an incredibly powerful editor in the right hands, as it can
allow you to speed your workflow up considerably. If that was all there is to
know about VIM, then likely everyone would switch to using it. However, there is
more to this story.

Part of what makes VIM so fast is the use of command keys. If you were going to
copy and paste something in traditional text editor, you would need to use the
mouse. Not in VIM. In fact, the mouse has no use in VIM. If you're using it
correctly, your hands will almost never leave the home row of keys. This has
some major benefits, however when you're first getting started, things can be
a bit difficult.

My first week of using VIM was rocky to say the least. Often when trying to
enter text, I would accidently enter some unknown sequence of commands, which
would have very unexpected behavior. This is particularly frustrating when
you're pair programming with another person, and they have to deal with you
opening obscure windows. Nevertheless, I remained a believer that if I stuck it
out, my skills would improve.

Week two was better. Your hands quickly develop muscle memory in regards to
which key combinations you need to hit and when. I would say that by the end of
the second week, I was developing software as fast with VIM as had been using
other editors previously. Not bad for a tool which I had no experience with only
a month ago.

Moving forward now, I'm excited by the prospect of continuing to work with VIM.
I've seen some more seasoned developers use VIM in ways that I've yet to even
attempt, and it seems as though the benefits to my workflow are virtually
limitless.
