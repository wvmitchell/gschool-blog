Well, I've made it this far. Four weeks in now, I feel like I've exhauseted all
of the knowledge I had prior to gSchool starting, and every day is now
a adventure into the unknown. For the last two weeks, I worked with my fellow
gSchooler, Rolen (@RolenTLe) on the oft infuriating Sales Engine. This project
marked a number of firsts for me, including my first attempts at
metaprogramming, as well as pair programming.

Building anything with metaprogramming feels a lot like magic. Unfortunately,
firguring out what has gone wrong when something (inevitablely) does, is equally
mysterious. Rolan and I both spent many hours over the last two weeks trying to
decipher unusual and unexpected error messages.

Although I've only just started to utilize it, I can already see the huge impact
that pair programming will eventually have on my workflow. By working in 25
minute 'pomodoros', and switching off the responsibility of coding, Rolan and
I were able to program much faster than we would have otherwise.

I'm still unsure as to how exactly I'll apply these fantastic skills I'm picking
up once this program is finished, but I've become convinced that I'll have
plenty of options to choose from.

Until next time,
Will
