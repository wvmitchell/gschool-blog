So we've got less than 2 months left...hmmm, well that's a little terrifying. It
seems like there is so much to do between now and then, that not getting
overwhelmed is going to be a key goal. While the overarching aim of this program
is to find some kind of employment, it's important to me that I get everything
I can out of the program while I'm here. Thus, I anticipate do a lot of coding,
as well as job searching, over the next two months.

I've started to generate a list of companies which I would like to interview
for, and although I'm still unsure as to how I'll go about securing those
interviews, getting in the door at these companies is a top priority for me. I'm
actually not overly concerned with preparing for these, as my sense is everyday
I spend at gSchool is a form of interview preparation.

To that end, it's very important to me that I finish the program on a high note.
In a group of high achieving people, it can be difficult to gauge one's own
effort. Even so, I think I can place myself at times during this program where
my effort was less than 100%. I would like to not have any of those lapses
during the final 7 weeks here.

Our current project is an API service providing interesting metrics on social
data. As a stated learning goal, I asked to be the project manager for my team.
I think that as I go forward in this field, my technical prowess will be
augmented by an ability to deal with different types of personalities in teams,
thus, I figured taking the reigns a project manager would be a good step.

Part of being me means dealing with not always wanting to work hard. Admitting
that I struggle with this has been instrumental in overcoming the challenge. As
I come down the homestretch of this program, I need to contend with this ever
present hurdle. For the most part, this means happily taking on the difficult
tasks, and being accountable to my team.
